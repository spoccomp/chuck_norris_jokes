# chuck_norris_jokes
chuck norris joke api using ruby
This code is to get API data which consists of Chuck Norris jokes. I created a class that utilizes class methods to access the specific 
data points on the API. Also created a Gemfile that incorporated HTTParty and Colorize gems. HTTParty is to access the API and Colorize was 
to style the command line text with colors.
